--Thank you For this opportunity-------------------------

1. I have used Material UI for the most of the UI Parts.

2. For the owl carousel i have used a third party package.

3. I have tried to Implement all the features except the pagination in Featured Component because the tenor api allows me to fetch only 50 results

4. For the Trending Gifs part the tenor-api dont have dedicate api endpoint so i used feautured api reesults in the carousel

-----------------------------------------Thank you----------
